Hangman is a guessing game in which One player(or computer) thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain  number of guesses. Originally a Paper-and-pencil game, there are now electronic versions.In this game we provide a word guessing game.Although the game's roots are  unknown, a variant is referenced in Alice Gomme's 1894 collection of kid-friendly games Birds, Creatures, and Fishes.Instead of using a picture of a hung man, this variation(which is same as ours) relies on keeping track of how many tries each player made to fill in the blanks.After a certain number of incorrect guesses, the game ends and the player loses. The game also ends if the player correctly identifies all the letters of the missing word.
RULES OF THE GAME:
1. You have to first choose which type of word you want to guess(plants,animals,fruits and vegetables).
2. You are then given ten chances to guess the secret word.
3. If you guess wrong one chance will be deducted.
4. If you guess the right letter all chances are retained(you do not lose a chance).
5. If the same letter is repeated regardless of it being wrong or right a chance will be deducted.
6. You win the game if you guess the word before all of your chances run out.

 YOU CAN NOW PLAY AND ENJOY HANGMAN!!!
